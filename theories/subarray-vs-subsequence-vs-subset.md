In my opinion, if the given pattern is array, the so called subarray means contiguous subsequence.

For example, if given {1, 2, 3, 4}, subarray can be

{1, 2, 3}
{2, 3, 4}
etc.
While the given pattern is a sequence, subsequence contain elements whose subscripts are increasing in the original sequence.

For example, also {1, 2, 3, 4}, subsequence can be

{1, 3}
{1ï¼Œ4}
etc.
While the given pattern is a set, subset contain any possible combinations of original set.

For example, {1, 2, 3, 4}, subset can be

{1}
{2}
{3}
{4}
{1, 2}
{1, 3}
{1, 4}
{2, 3}
etc.
